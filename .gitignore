# Area files (assume these are runtime modified for now, unless user says otherwise)
# Actually, I'll not ignore area files in gitignore, but I just won't add them right now.
# But git status will show them as modified.
# If I put them in gitignore, git will ignore the changes to tracked files? No, gitignore only affects untracked files.
# To ignore changes to tracked files, I'd need 'git update-index --assume-unchanged'.
# For now, I just won't 'git add' them.
